      "description": "Cox's Bazar (Bengali: কক্সবাজার Kôks bajar) is a town, a fishing port and district headquarters in Bangladesh. The beach in Cox's Bazar is an unbroken 125 km sandy sea beach with a gentle slope, one of the world's longest.[2][3][4] It is located 150 km south of the industrial port Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, whose literal translation means \"yellow flower.\" Its other old name was \"Palongkee\".\nThe modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox (died 1799), an officer of the British East India Company. Cox was appointed Superintendent of Palongkee outpost after Warren Hastings became Governor of Bengal. Captain Cox was specially mobilised to deal with a century-long conflict between Arakan refugees and local Rakhains. He embarked upon the task of rehabilitating refugees in the area and made significant progress. Captain Cox died in 1799 before he could finish his work. To commemorate his role in rehabilitation work, a market was established and named Cox's Bazar (\"Cox's Market\") after him.\nToday, Cox's Bazar is one of the most-visited tourist destinations in Bangladesh, though it is not a major international tourist destination, and has no international hotel chains. In 2013, the Bangladesh Government formed the Tourist Police unit to better protect local and foreign tourists, as well as to look after the nature and wildlife in the tourist spots of Cox's Bazar.",

Since Bangladesh has very little rainfall in the winter, the requirement of water for irrigation during the season is met from ground water sources and by conserving a part of the monsoon surface water. To do this, the Local Government Engineering Department in Bangladesh has introduced rubber dams, a cost effective technology that retains and conserves surface water in the river channel, reservoirs and lakes. It has constructed two pilot rubber dams in the Bakkhali River and Idagaon Khal in Cox’s Bazar district that would supply irrigation water to 8,000 hectares for rice cultivation."

There is a small adjoining island that is separated at high tide, called Chera Dwip. It is about 8 kilometres (5 miles) west of the northwest coast ofMyanmar, at the mouth of the Naf River.\nThe first settlement started 250 years ago by Arabian sailors who named the island 'Zajira'. During British occupation the island was named St. Martin Island. During the First Anglo-Burmese War between the British and Burmese empires in 1824–1826, rival claims to the island were a major factor. The local names of the island are \"Narical Gingira\", also spelled \"Narikel Jinjira/Jinjera\", which means 'Coconut Island' in Bengali, and \"Daruchini Dwip\". It is the only coral island in Bangladesh.",
